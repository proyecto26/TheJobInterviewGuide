## Introduce yourself

> Structure your introduction in parts, adapt each one depending on the company and interviewer. Not every interview needs every section — read the room. Pick one intro style and combine it with the building blocks below.

---

### Intro Style A: Impact-Driven

> Best for startups, high-growth teams, and roles where they need someone who ships and owns outcomes.

I'm a Senior Full-Stack Engineer with over 13 years of experience building, scaling, and owning products end-to-end across startups, enterprise, and high-growth teams. I've often joined projects at early or critical stages, where ownership, speed, and collaboration are essential to deliver real value to users.

A big part of my career has been working as a founding or early engineer, helping define architecture, technical direction, and development standards while staying very hands-on. For example, at `<COMPANY_NAME>`, I helped architect the marketplace from the ground up, designing both frontend and backend systems, integrating blockchain workflows, and scaling the platform to over 140,000 users. That work directly improved conversion and retention, and required close collaboration with product, design, and leadership to move quickly without sacrificing quality.

More recently, I've worked as a freelance and contract engineer through my own company, Proyecto26, delivering short-term, high-impact projects. I supported `<COMPANY_NAME>` on an internal monitoring platform, improving stability and reliability across dozens of services. I also built a real-time event-driven backend for a Web3 trading platform, processing hundreds of blockchain events per second with sub-second latency to the UI. In another project, I led the migration of a slow, microfrontend-based HR platform to a modern SSR architecture, significantly improving performance and user experience for critical onboarding flows.

Across all these roles, what stands out is my focus on ownership and outcomes. I like to understand the user problem deeply, propose solutions, implement them, and follow through in production. I'm comfortable working autonomously, but I strongly believe in collaboration — pairing with teammates, aligning with product and design, and sharing context early so we can move fast together.

What really defines my experience is the ability to balance speed, quality, and impact: shipping quickly, iterating based on feedback, and taking responsibility for the systems I build and the users who depend on them.

---

### Intro Style B: Full Profile

> Best for companies that want to see the complete picture — who you are, what you bring technically, and what you care about beyond code.

I'm J.D. Nicholls, a Systems Engineer, Senior Full-Stack Developer, and Open-Source Contributor from Medellin, Colombia (proud paisa/latino), with 13+ years of experience building and scaling web, mobile, and distributed systems across startups, enterprise, and Web3.

I've worked as a founding engineer and technical lead on multiple products, where I designed architectures from zero to production, scaled platforms to hundreds of thousands of users, and solved complex problems around reliability, performance, and developer experience. I'm especially passionate about event-driven systems, workflow orchestration, and resilient architectures, and I've used tools like Temporal extensively to handle critical business processes.

Beyond my professional work, I'm deeply involved in the tech community as a speaker, mentor, and community contributor. I regularly share knowledge at events and meetups such as JSConf, CityJS, MedellinJS, and community workshops, focusing on topics like distributed systems, full-stack architecture, and modern frontend and backend development. I'm also the creator of [Proyecto26](https://github.com/proyecto26), an open-source organization on GitHub where I build and maintain tools used by developers worldwide.

**Core Skills & Expertise**
- **Full-Stack Engineering:** End-to-end ownership from product requirements to production
- **Distributed Systems:** Event-driven architectures, workflows, real-time processing
- **Frontend Architecture:** Scalable React-based systems, SSR, performance optimization
- **Backend & APIs:** High-throughput services, observability, reliability
- **Leadership & Mentorship:** Guiding teams, code reviews, talks, workshops

**Programming Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, C#, Solidity (working knowledge), SQL

**Frameworks & Libraries:** React, RemixJS, React Router, React Native, NestJS, Node.js, Ionic, Angular, NgRx, Redux Toolkit, React Query, Temporal SDKs (TypeScript & Python)

**Tools & Platforms:** Redis (Streams, TimeSeries), WebSockets, gRPC, AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, Datadog, PostHog, GitHub, CI/CD pipelines

**Interests:** When I'm not coding or speaking, I enjoy traveling as a digital nomad, discovering new cultures, and sampling dark chocolate wherever I go. I'm also a tennis enthusiast and, most importantly, a proud father of two amazing kids — Kiara and Dante, my greatest inspiration.

---

### Personal (Optional)

> Some companies are people-first and want to know who you are beyond the code. If the interviewer gives you space for it or the culture values it, share a bit about yourself. Keep it real — this is not a script.

I'm from Medellin, Colombia. One of my dreams has always been to travel the world, meet people from different cultures, and learn from them — that's why I started working remotely several years ago, and it's been one of the best decisions I've made.

Outside of work, I like making 2D games, creating video tutorials, playing tennis, and working on side projects that mix technology with creativity. I'm a mentor and speaker in local communities because I genuinely believe that sharing what you know is how you keep growing. I also enjoy astronomy and people watching — there's something about observing how the world works that inspires the way I build things.

### STRENGTHS

I think I'm very good at working in a team, I've been doing that since I've been working so I think I've become very good at that. And I believe I have good technical skills using different lenguages and tools and good communication skills.
I'm very responsible, reliable and disciplined person.

### WEAKNESSES

- I get distracted easily and do not feel so motivated when I work alone, for that reason I use to have pair programming meetings with my team, to share knowledge but most important to be focus on my tasks and have a lot of motivation working together.
- Sometimes I used to be stubborn when I knew that something can be done better and I took extra part of my personal time to achieve it, because of that I started giving these points for improvement in retrospective meetings, during the planning of our sprints, to take these into account as part of the estimation process because nothing is perfect, everything can be improved, to avoid procrastination.
- In a job where you have to work under pressure and have to commit to strict deadlines, estimating used to be a complicated task for me, so with experience I began to prioritize tasks and dip complexity into simpler tasks with small deadlines to be more efficient while seeing progress soon.
- I used to be a perfectionist in my work, but with experience working with others I learned that Good is better than perfect, because there's trade-off between being agreeable and being execution oriented, when you move fast, you can be aggresive and frustrate the people who want to get things done too

### SUPERPOWER

<details>
  <summary><b>What is your superpower, and what is that one thing you do better than anyone else?</b></summary>

  What I do better than most is connecting the dots across product, engineering, and execution. I can zoom out to see the system as a whole — architecture, workflows, trade-offs — and then zoom back in to implement the details hands-on. That allows me to move fast without creating long-term messes.

  I'm also very consistent under pressure. When things are unclear, timelines are tight, or systems are failing, I tend to stay calm, prioritize what matters, and help the team move forward. That combination of clarity, ownership, and execution is where I add the most value.
</details>

## Experience

<details>
  <summary><b>Tell me about a situation when you failed</b></summary>

  - Scaling a problem instead of having a direct conversation with my coworker first.
  - I remember once I started on a project that was delayed, having sprints of a week and also I got a hard deadline here. This project was using deprecated libraries and I spent a lot of time updating everything to avoid code refactors in the future, in the end it was a success but I was tired and bored because I had invested a lot of my free time.
</details>

> It's better if you keep iterating and make it better as well as you need instead of trying to make everything perfect the first time, to avoid frustration because nothing will ever truly be perfect **(Perfect is the enemy of good)** and being able to recognize the value of constructive criticism.

<details>
  <summary><b>How would your boss and co-workers describe you?</b></summary>

  - Recognized for being helpful with the team
  - Known for being assertive in proposing solutions and ideas
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What made you leave your most recent job? / Why are you looking to leave your current job?</b></summary>

  My most recent work has been contract and freelance-based, which was a deliberate choice. I wanted the flexibility to work on a few high-impact projects, help teams solve specific problems quickly, and broaden my exposure across different domains. That experience has been valuable, but I'm now at a point where I'm looking for long-term ownership and deeper impact.

  I'm specifically seeking a role where I can commit fully to a single product and team, take responsibility beyond delivery, and help shape both the technical direction and the culture as the company scales. That's what motivates me to move from short-term engagements into a focused, high-ownership role like this one.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What do you expect with this job?</b></summary>

  I'm looking for high ownership, meaningful impact, and strong collaboration. I want to work on a product where engineering decisions matter, where I can take responsibility end-to-end, and where the team is focused on solving real user problems rather than just shipping features.

  From a technology perspective, I'm excited by modern full-stack systems, especially those involving event-driven architectures, workflow orchestration (Temporal), and scalable frontends (NextJS, React Router, React Query, TanStack, React Native, etc). I enjoy working with teams that value clean design, pragmatic trade-offs, and continuous improvement over rigid process.

  Overall, I'm looking for a role where I can fully commit, grow alongside the team, and help build something durable, useful, and impactful.
</details>
  
<details>

  - Supporting Open Source projects while I'm creating awesome apps.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How you deal with getting stuck?</b></summary>

  I prefer to rely on my team instead of spending a lot of time solving any problem on my own.
  - Else if, I try to find out if it's a common mistake or if someone has had the same problem.
  - Else if none of the above works, I seek to report the error in case someone else can help me and in the meantime I try to figure this out for myself.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?</b></summary>
  
  - Stopping to take a moment (10 deep breaths), break the problem into specific issues and priorize to solve that critical situation.
</details>

<details>

  - I want to create more side projects, apps and games of my own ideas.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What are you looking for in a new position?</b></summary>

  High ownership, meaningful impact, and strong collaboration. I want to work on a product where engineering decisions matter, where I can take responsibility end-to-end, and where the team is focused on solving real user problems rather than just shipping features.

  Team dynamics are very important to me. I'm looking for a culture with clear expectations, direct communication, and mutual accountability — where people trust each other, give honest feedback, and move fast together. I do my best work in environments that reward initiative and where engineers are encouraged to think beyond their immediate scope.

  What I'd like to avoid are environments with low ownership, excessive bureaucracy/micromanagement, or unclear accountability — where decisions stall, feedback is avoided, or impact is hard to measure. I'm also not interested in roles where engineers are isolated from product/users or where process matters more than outcomes.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</b></summary>
  
  - I’m looking forward to being a tech interviewer in the next 2 years, I’ve been practicing algorithms, mock interviews and behavioral questions with some books like **Cracking the Coding Interview**, also participating in communities, and I started creating a resource called “The Job Interview Guide”, in order to help other developers to get a great job!
  - Developing into a great developer, being an international speaker and helping other developers to grow in this profession is something I'm really excited about.
  - I'd like to be seen as someone with deep expertise as Sofwate Architect, being able to build large-scale systems that can face many interesting challenges.
  - Well, hopefully working for your company. I would like to first become very good at my job. And then after that I will be ready to asume new responsabilities and go for the next step.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What type of work environment do you prefer?</b></summary>

  A culture with clear expectations, direct communication, and mutual accountability — where people trust each other, give honest feedback, and move fast together. I do my best work in environments that reward initiative and where engineers are encouraged to think beyond their immediate scope.

  I enjoy working with teams that value clean design, pragmatic trade-offs, and continuous improvement over rigid process. I like working remotely, but I also value strong collaboration — having the flexibility to share with my colleagues and my family while being deeply connected to the team and the product.
</details>
  
<details>
  <summary><b>What's time you exercised leadership?</b></summary>

  - Most of the time during meetings, talking about development, etc but I prefer to delegate responsibilities, so anyone on the team can be a leader!
</details>
  
<details>
  <summary><b>What's time you disagreed with a decision that was made at work?</b></summary>

  - I remember once a **PM** had coordinated a delivery with the client, so we have a meeting with the **Architect** because I did not agree to make decisions without taking the team into account, at the end of the day we had the opportunity to clarify everything and make a better decision all together :)
</details>
  
<details>
  <summary><b>Have you ever worked with an engineer who wasn't performing well?</b></summary>
- I remember once a developer lied to me about an assigned task because he had been late in completing it, a colleague told me what happened but I preferred to give him a second chance, help him understand the problem he had to avoid it happen again and then he was able to perform the tasks very well.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What is it about you that makes you a good fit for this position? / What makes you the ideal candidate for this role?</b></summary>

  I'm an ideal candidate for this role because I consistently operate with end-to-end ownership in fast-moving environments where ambiguity is high and impact matters. Over 13 years, I've worked as a founding and senior engineer in startups and high-growth teams, building products from scratch, stabilizing critical systems, and scaling platforms used by thousands of users.

  What differentiates me is my ability to move fast without losing quality. I'm comfortable making technical and product decisions, shipping iteratively, and learning from real user feedback. I've designed and delivered complex systems — ranging from financial and Web3 platforms to enterprise monitoring tools — where reliability, flexibility, and performance were essential.

  I also bring a strong collaborative mindset. I work closely with product, design, and other engineers to deeply understand user needs and translate them into practical, scalable solutions. I don't wait for perfect specs or processes; I help create them, unblock teams, and raise the bar with every release.

  Most importantly, I care about outcomes, not just execution. I take responsibility for what I build in production and how it impacts users and the business. That mindset, combined with my experience in early-stage and high-intensity environments, aligns very closely with `<COMPANY_NAME>`'s culture of ownership, excellence, and velocity.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Why do you want to work with us?</b></summary>

  > Use your [deep research](prompts/research/) to mention something genuine here. Reference specific things you found about the company — a blog post, a value, a product decision — not generic statements.

  What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to combine my technical expertise with `<COMPANY_NAME>`'s vision. I've always been passionate about creating solutions that not only solve immediate challenges but also set the foundation for future growth. `<COMPANY_NAME>`'s culture of innovation, collaboration, and impact feels like a genuine match for how I like to work and what I care about.

  Personally, nothing motivates me more than seeing that my work can make people's lives easier — adding my "grain of sand" to change the world by creating creative and innovative solutions that empower people. I also value authenticity, taking risks, and helping others (I believe that most of the world's problems can be solved by connecting people).

  Professionally, the opportunity to work with talented people, solve interesting problems with technology, and have good spaces for sharing knowledge to help me make better decisions, build better products, and create better experiences for everyone.

  I'm genuinely excited about contributing to the team and bringing my experience in scalable architectures, workflow design, and team collaboration to help `<COMPANY_NAME>` achieve its goals. I look forward to what we can build together.

> Maybe mention your own ideas about social changes, etc, e.g => https://github.com/proyecto26/social-change

<details>
  <summary><b>Tell me about a technical challenge you solved recently</b></summary>

  > Use the [STAR method](BEHAVIORAL_CONCEPTS.md) — pick 1-2 examples relevant to the role.

  One example that highlights my experience is a recent project where I designed workflows for critical business processes using Temporal. The goal was to simplify a highly complex architecture while ensuring scalability and reliability. I worked closely with cross-functional teams to define requirements, implemented event-driven architectures, and created clear documentation for onboarding other developers. As a result, the workflow reduced processing time by 30%, significantly improving efficiency.

  Beyond that, I've worked with technologies like React, Node.js, and low-code tools, creating modular architectures and scalable solutions. At `<COMPANY_NAME>`, I collaborated directly with the CTO and Product Owners to design a platform from the ground up, ensuring it could adapt to rapid growth while meeting business objectives.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Tell me about your leadership and community involvement</b></summary>

  In addition to my technical contributions, I have a strong passion for leadership and mentorship. I've actively mentored developers through pair programming, code reviews, and knowledge-sharing sessions. I've hosted workshops at CityJS about building workflows with Temporal for JavaScript developers, and I regularly participate in community events to discuss event-driven architectures for full-stack developers. Sharing my knowledge and learning from others has always been a core part of my career.

  I'm also the founder of [Proyecto26](https://github.com/proyecto26), an open-source organization where I've created and maintained libraries and tools used by developers worldwide — with millions of downloads globally. This involves not only writing clean, maintainable code but also managing issues, responding to user feedback, and fostering a collaborative environment for contributors. I've also been mentoring developers through initiatives like CodeYourFuture, BeeSoft Labs, and LaPlazaDevs. Recently, I've been exploring AI agents, skills, and tools — not just using them but creating open-source projects around them to solve real challenges creatively.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What professional accomplishment are you most proud of?</b></summary>

  - Designed the baseline for cross-platform mobile applications in different companies.
  - At **Yuxi**, I had the opportunity to mentor a junior developer by delegating leadership responsibilities, helping her develop confidence, and take on new challenges to enhance her soft skills. Because at the end of the day it does not matter who the leader is, but rather that we're happy in what we're doing.
  - At my current company I had the opportunity to start working for a Startup that later was acquired by Nordstrom, I had the responsability to investigate new Frontend technologies (Frameworks), migrate some apps and then I defined a modular architecture with **React Native** that today is used for multiple teams. With the help of the team, 2 weeks ago, on the **Nordstrom Anniversary**, the app reached a million dollars in one day, that was impressive!
</details>
  
<details>
  <summary><b>What's your greatest professional achievement?</b></summary>
  
  - My best professional achievement is **Proyecto 26**, I created it with the idea of Changing the world with small contributions, basically Open Source projects that can have a positive impact on the world. I've reach more than 1 million downloads with one of my plugins (A native plugin for platforms like iOS and Android in order to improve the user experience), so it's used by a lot of projects and during the process I've had the opportunity to work with people from all over the world and learn a lot!
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What exceptional work have you done?</b></summary>

  One piece of work I'm most proud of is building the `<COMPANY_NAME>` marketplace from scratch as a founding engineer. I designed the full-stack architecture, from scalable React/Remix frontends to Node/NestJS backends, and introduced event-driven workflows with Temporal to handle critical business processes and blockchain integrations. The platform scaled to 140k+ active users, improved conversion by 50%, and increased retention by 30%. Beyond the technical impact, I helped establish engineering foundations, mentored teammates, and aligned closely with product and leadership to deliver real business value.

<details>
  <summary><b>What is the last significant thing you learned to do your job better?</b></summary>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What would you do differently in your next role?</b></summary>

  I'd focus on long-term ownership from day one. In my recent freelance and contract work, I delivered high-impact results, but the nature of short-term engagements means you move on before seeing the full lifecycle of what you built. In my next role, I want to fully commit to a single product and team — take responsibility beyond delivery, and help shape both the technical direction and the culture as the company scales.

  I'd also be more intentional about avoiding environments with low ownership or excessive bureaucracy — where decisions stall, feedback is avoided, or impact is hard to measure. I want to be in a place where engineers are encouraged to think beyond their immediate scope and where process serves outcomes, not the other way around.
