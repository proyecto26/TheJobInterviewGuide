# Recruiter Communication

> **Phase 3 from the [HIRED! How to Get a Job in 2026](../../guides/GET_A_JOB_EN.pdf) guide:** Communicate with confidence, not neediness.

```
I'm in an interview process with <COMPANY_NAME> and I need to communicate with the
recruiter in the following situation: <SITUATION>

Process context: <PROCESS_CONTEXT>
Last message I received: <LAST_MESSAGE>

Help me draft a response that demonstrates:
- That I'm active and willing to collaborate
- Confidence and security, not neediness or desperation
- Genuine interest in the opportunity, not urgency
- That I'm helpful and assertive

The response should be professional, concise and create a positive impression. It
shouldn't be instant (seem too eager) nor late, but timely. If I have any questions
about the process, they should be smart questions that show interest, not obvious ones.
```
