# Mental Process Video

> **Phase 2 from the [HIRED! How to Get a Job in 2026](../../guides/GET_A_JOB_EN.pdf) guide:** Document your process, not just the result.

```
I just completed a technical test for <COMPANY_NAME> and I want to record a Loom video
(max 5 minutes) to accompany my submission. Help me prepare a structured script that
demonstrates my mental and creative process.

This is the test I solved: <TEST_DESCRIPTION>
These are the main technical decisions I made: <KEY_DECISIONS>
This is a specific knowledge I want to highlight: <UNIQUE_HIGHLIGHT>

The video should follow this structure:
- Intro (30 seconds): Who I am and what I solved
- Problem (1 minute): What challenge the test presented
- Solution and the WHY (3-5 minutes): My decisions, why I made them, the advantages
  of what I implemented and the results
- My differentiator (1-2 minutes): A specific knowledge or approach that makes me
  stand out

Help me write the key points for each section, prioritizing results and advantages
of my decisions, not just what I did but why I did it that way.
```
