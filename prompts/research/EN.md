# Deep Company Research

> **Phase 4 from the [HIRED! How to Get a Job in 2026](../../guides/GET_A_JOB_EN.pdf) guide:** Research like you're already on the team.

```
I want you to research everything about <COMPANY_NAME> using the following links:
* <WEBSITE_URL>
* <BLOG_URL>
* <LINKEDIN_COMPANY_URL>/posts/?feedView=all
* <FUNDING_URLS/OTHER_LINKS/ETC>

____

I'm looking to understand how <COMPANY_NAME> works, how they generate value for their
clients/users, what problems they truly solve, what their differentiating element is
along with their company values, and everything that will help me be prepared for an
interview with them. This is the interviewer's profile at this company:

INTERVIEWER_PROFILE_DESCRIPTION

Please use all your skills for learning/research/deep-research to understand more about
this company, and then let's create a document like a scientific paper about the company,
the problem, the solution, and the model they propose/offer with their tools.
