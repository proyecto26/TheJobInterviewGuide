# Know Your Interviewer

> **Phase 5 from the [HIRED! How to Get a Job in 2026](../../guides/GET_A_JOB_EN.pdf) guide:** Interviews are conversations between people, not skill assessments.

```
My next interviewer at <COMPANY_NAME> is this person:

Name: <INTERVIEWER_NAME>
Role: <INTERVIEWER_ROLE>
LinkedIn profile: <INTERVIEWER_LINKEDIN_URL>
Description/Bio: <INTERVIEWER_BIO>

I want to understand their professional trajectory: what they've built, what they're
passionate about, what they've worked on, and what their interests are. Look for posts,
articles, talks, or projects they've shared.

With this information, help me identify:
- Connection points between their experience and mine
- Topics that could generate a genuine conversation
- Examples from my experience that relate to what they've done or value
- How to mention these points naturally during the interview, without it seeming
  forced or memorized
```
