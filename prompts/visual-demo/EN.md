# Visual Demonstration

> **Phase 6 from the [HIRED! How to Get a Job in 2026](../../guides/GET_A_JOB_EN.pdf) guide:** You can't visualize what you don't understand.

```
I've already deeply researched the company <COMPANY_NAME> and I have a document/paper
with all the information. Now I want to create a visual element that demonstrates my
understanding of the business to present in the interview.

This is the summary of my research:
<RESEARCH_SUMMARY>

I want to generate a <VISUAL_TYPE> that communicates clearly and professionally:
- The problem the company solves
- The solution and how it impacts their clients/users
- The key differentiator against competitors
- Ideas on how they could expand/scale their solution

The goal is to reduce something abstract/complex into something visual that shows I
truly understood the business and that I can contribute value. This should generate
organic conversation points during the interview, demonstrate genuine interest and
professionalism.

Visual types: comic, architecture diagram, product flow, infographic, business model
map, or any format that best communicates the message.

You can use existing AI skills/plugins to generate comics and other visual elements.
