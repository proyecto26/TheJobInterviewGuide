# Visual Demonstration

> **Phase 6 from the [HIRED! How to Get a Job in 2026](../../guides/GET_A_JOB_EN.pdf) guide:** You can't visualize what you don't understand.

```
I've already deeply researched the company <COMPANY_NAME> and I have a document/paper
with all the information. Now I want to create a visual element that demonstrates my
understanding of the business to present in the interview.

This is the summary of my research:
<RESEARCH_SUMMARY>

I want to generate a <VISUAL_TYPE> that communicates clearly and professionally:
- The industry problem (before the company existed)
- The solution and how it impacts their clients/users (the after)
- The value proposition and key differentiator against competitors
- How they generate value and their business model
- Ideas on how they could expand/scale their solution (e.g. offering their services
  through modern tools like MCP servers, AI Skills, Agents)

The goal is to transform complex data into a visual narrative (pitch deck style) that
shows I truly understood the business and that I can contribute value. This should
generate organic conversation points during the interview; when the interviewer asks
"What do you know about us?", I can ask permission to share my screen and present this.

Visual types: comic, architecture diagram, product flow, infographic, business model
map or any format that best communicates the message.

You can use existing AI skills/plugins to generate comics and other visual elements.
