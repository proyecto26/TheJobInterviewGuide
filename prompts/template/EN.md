# Prepare Your Template/Project

> **Phase 1 from the [HIRED! How to Get a Job in 2026](../../guides/GET_A_JOB_EN.pdf) guide:** Build your arsenal BEFORE you need it.

```
I want to prepare an Open Source template/project that I can reuse for technical
interview take-home tests. I need you to help me create or customize an existing
template like [this one](https://github.com/proyecto26/projectx) that demonstrates
architecture decisions, not just code.

The goal is to never start from zero in each job process. The repository should be
organized to facilitate copy-paste of common functionalities (e.g. authentication,
forums, APIs, CRUD patterns) so I can move fast during timed tests.

The template should include:
- Testing setup (unit, integration, e2e)
- CI/CD pipeline
- Professional documentation (README, ADRs, CONTRIBUTING)
- Best practices for my stack: <MY_TECH_STACK>
- Scalable and maintainable project structure
- Common reusable modules ready to plug in

This is a base template I want to use/customize: <TEMPLATE_URL>

I want the template to demonstrate professional judgment and production thinking,
because AI can implement fast but I demonstrate the decisions. Help me identify what
architecture decisions and configurations I should include to stand out from candidates
who only implement without structure.

It should also be a public Open Source project to demonstrate experience, community
contributions and initiative; presenting myself as a founder/creator, not just a coder.
