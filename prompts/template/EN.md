# Prepare Your Template/Project

> **Phase 1 from the [HIRED! How to Get a Job in 2026](../../guides/GET_A_JOB_EN.pdf) guide:** Build your arsenal BEFORE you need it.

```
I want to prepare an Open Source template/project that I can reuse for technical
interview take-home tests. I need you to help me create or customize an existing template like [this one](https://github.com/proyecto26/projectx) that
demonstrates architecture decisions, not just code.

The template should include:
- Testing setup (unit, integration, e2e)
- CI/CD pipeline
- Professional documentation (README, ADRs, CONTRIBUTING)
- Best practices for my stack: <MY_TECH_STACK>
- Scalable and maintainable project structure

This is a base template I want to use/customize: <TEMPLATE_URL>

I want the template to demonstrate professional judgment and production thinking, because
AI can implement fast but I demonstrate the decisions. Help me identify what architecture
decisions and configurations I should include to stand out from candidates who only
implement without structure.
```
