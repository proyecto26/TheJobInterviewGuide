## Examples

<details>
  <summary><b>Describe a situation in which you were able to use persuasion to successfully convince someone to see things your way.</b></summary>

- Creating a new template with ASP.NET MVC to work with designers in a better way (Separation of concerns for the win, instead of using server-side controls).
- Use hybrid mobile frameworks (depending of the app) to reduce time to market and helping other teams (Become Ionic partners).
- Creating new native plugins to give a better user experience (Open Source projects).
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Describe a time when you were faced with a stressful situation that demonstrated your coping skills.</b></summary>

  - Working until the next day for a release to production (BevyUp)
  - My cat walking on the balcony (During a demo with the client)
    - Situation: I was in a meeting with a client, presenting a demo, when suddenly my wife appeared very scared and asked me for help because something was happening, then I realized that my little cat was walking on the edge of the balcony, I had to pause my presentation because I was so worried.
    - Task: Ask for a break and rescue my cat.
    - Action: I had to be brave and rescue the cat, then I was able to finish the presentation.
    - Result: I was able to face that so stressful situation because I was thinking in the solution instead of the problem, and then I was calm because I had been able to finish the presentation with the help of my team. 
  - A PoC with a new technology in a short period of time (StartUp Acquisition)
  - Working in a project with 1 week sprints (working weekends)
  - Excel generation tool migration with a class having more than 30k lines of code and without business formulas.
    - Situation: Code refactor of a software with more than 10 years in the market, and having classes of more than 30k lines of code, where the client did not know the formulas of the business with which more than 30 different critical excel files were exported.
    - Task: Looking to improve the UX (performance) for generating these files.
    - Action: I had to contribute to Open Source and created interfaces to simulate functionalities of a deprecated library. I spent some months working on this migration.
    - Result: Using benchmarks I was able to compare these tools, and I found some issues during this migration but with the help of these Open Source contributions (reporting issues, discussing and reviewing the code of the external lib) I was able to solve unforeseen problems.

  <summary><b>Give me a specific example of a time when you used good judgment and logic in solving a problem.</b></summary>
  
  - Creating a new Open Source project to improve UX with a native look & feel (React Native InAppBrowser).
  - Use memoization and Big O notation to reduce complexity with RxJS subscriptions.
  - Found SQL Injection issues concatenating Database queries from a third party system.
  - Using hooks to reduce code complexity and increase test coverage.
  - Using macros from Assembly lenguage to reduce complexity.

<details>
  <summary><b>Give me an example of a time when you set a goal and were able to meet or achieve it.</b></summary>

  - Using a new strategy to implement a real-time connection.
  - Database migration from NoSQL (MongoDB) to SQL & Multi-tenant (PostgreSQL) takes less than 3 months.
</details>
  
<details>
  <summary><b>Tell me about a time when you had to use your presentation skills to influence someone's opinion.</b></summary>

  - Comparison between React Native and NativeScript for cross-platform native UI apps.
  - Web Components and compilers instead of a Framework (Be agnostic, it Depends... maybe You don't need it).
  - Using promises for HTTP requests from Unity.
  - Divide and conquer (Avoid blocking tasks)
    - Situation: Implementing new features from a React Native app was giving us some problems, specially because we're using React class components with nested code, having complex local states with large components and repeated code, so it was difficult to maintain unit tests and increase test coverage.
    - Task: My goal was to help another Senior developer with a new feature adding a real-time connection from some screens of a chat module and increasing the test coverage of a complex component.
    - Action: We had some sessions of pair programming but I was stuck waiting for my partner to finish the dependent task assigned to him, so I decided to investigate on my own how to reduce the complexity of the current code and avoid adding nested code to the chat component. I learned about a new way to reuse code, extend behaviors easily and have components as small functions using functional programming and React hooks, while also implementing the real-time connection. As my colleague did not agree to do it in a different way, I proceeded to speak with the PM about the advantages that this new utility offered us and I made a presentation to share the knowledge gained about this new React feature with the rest of the team.
    - Result: We agreed with the team to use this new strategy for this implementation and thanks to this we were able to finish the feature 2 weeks ahead of schedule and increase test coverage by 20% by having small features that were much easier to maintain and test. Also, a few months later I made a talk about these topics for the rest of the company and it was shared on YouTube.

  <summary><b>Give me a specific example of a time when you had to conform to a policy with which you did not agree.</b></summary>
  
  - Using fingerprint to register arrival and departure time at work
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Please discuss an important written document you were required to complete.</b></summary>

  - Documenting multi-tenant architecture
    - Situation: Architecture documentation was required by the client.
    - Task: Create architecture documentation of the project about purpose, scope, business and technical architecture, data migration and deployment strategies, version management and environment set-up.
    - Action: I designed the first version of the document about architectural overview of the solution, to capture and convey the significant architectural decisions which have been made on the system.
    - Result: The documentation created was a good guide for new developers to understand the scope of the project, listing all definitions, references and human operations involved to support business processes which are triggered and generate business events. With this guide I defined each business process, design patterns and principles used in the project, coding conventions, describing frameworks, services and dependencies involved in the execution, defining the tiers where the software components are deployed and executed, listing functional and non-functional requirements and about technical architecture I generated component, deployment, package, use case and entity relationship diagrams to illustrate the logical structure and organization of the project. I identified opportunities for improvement about deployment strategies to automate the process publishing new releases to Production environment and avoiding risks to access to the database externally due to default configurations.

## Remember
- Be yourself; mention where I have been wrong, I have failed **(Everyone makes mistakes)** and express the initiatives that I have taken.
- Talk more about what I did, instead of talking so much about what we did as a team; e.g: I disccused with the manager, I shared a technical presentation with the team and together we managed to decide this. Talk with your team
- There have been several situations where I failed, did I communicate it in time? it is important to mention it
- Be honest, express if I made bad decisions, if it took me longer, and that I learned from the process.
- How do you interact with the team?
- How do I react to failure? Show what I learned from the experience to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
- Give numbers, coverage improved, how much percentage? improved sales, how much? Did the decisions I made help make life easier for users?
- Focused more about the product and business than technology, its important to ask yourself what are we doing? what is the goal of what we are building? to align the vision with the product team.
- Show them you take responsibility for mistakes.
- Keep it brief and concise. Try to tell the story in chronological order, too, without having to go back and forward in time repeatedly.
